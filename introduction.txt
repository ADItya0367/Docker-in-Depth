Docker definitoin :- docker is mainly a software that helps in developing, running and 
shipping our software . it is mainly used in the case when 
we are working in an organisation and everyone has to work on their own specific 
operating system , duue to this at the time of production 
our code mainly fails and we encounters many conflicts .

in order to resolve this issue we mainly use docker which is a tool that enable us to
write our software on it without worring about the infrastructures 


by using docker our all environment becomes same , local , testing and production 
earlier we have to install all the required softwares to build our software but 
suppose in case we don not have large hard disk space , so their docker plays an important role 

GOAL: is to work on one operating system irrespective of thinking about the infrastructure 
 
 Docker provides us an operatig system on which we can perform our operations 
 and it fully relies on Microservice architecture design pattern of software


 ** on production we mainly use the Linux operating system , and the main 
 linux distributions are as follows 
 -ubuntu
 -fedora
 -debian
 -mandriva
 -cent os 

** whenever a project is createed then at tht time only the version of operating system is
selected and then entire team workws on that version of os 
example - ubuntu:20.0

Docker mainky  helps us in creation of containers . a container is a  virtual space 
where we can run oour services or operating system .container mainly provides
the required credentials for developing our applications 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Why do we need docker ??

 - it provides consistent and fast delivery of softwares much faster
 - containers mainly provide sthe facility of CI/CD  continious integration and deploymemnt 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ARCHITECTURE OF DOCKER 

The architecture of dockerc mainly contains three things 
1)- CLIENT- matlab humara operating system 
2)- DEAMON- deamon ka main kam ye h ki sare services ko run karega, it stores every data into one single directory and track each and every 
    happenings that are done with images networks and containers 
3)- REGISTRY- registry is mainly a hub which provides us the different images of operating system , through which we download our images and work on it 
and hence iploading at last .


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BEFORE PROCEDDING 
-make sure to enable virtual technology by going into your bios , virtual technology helps is a functionality that helps us in the smooth running
of operating system . if it is disabled then our operating system will not be performing well.... it will lag .

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DOCKER CLIENT
as we have alredy seen that docker client is just our operating system so ...we have to install it locally but we will not be working 
with the client ... we will direct work on the vscode
